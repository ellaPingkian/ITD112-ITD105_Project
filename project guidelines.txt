ITD112 - project 

* Project #1
Using the principles of data story telling develop a Dashboard (web app) for the dengue data from 2016-2021.

Note: (Dataset provided)Additional points if stored in Database

POSSIBLE ANALYSIS 
* Total number of Dengue Cases by Region
* Reported Dengue Cases in the Philippines
* Total number of Dengue Deaths by Region

1. Dot Map - for affected areas (col1, r1 & r2)
	- also to determine the location where the
	highest number of dengue occured

	Choropleth - also regional level

1.1 Total number of recorded dengue cases by location
	Options: By specific location
		 By region

2. bar graph - sum of deaths caused by dengue in each
	location (col2, r1)
	Options: By specific Location
		 By region
		 By Year

3. Line graph - reported dengue cases in the Philippines (col2, r2
	Options: By year
		 By year by location
		 By month (2016-2021) this could further
			determine when is the season where
			mosquitos breed


Note: Include Elements of a Data Story
1. Context and Setting (Header)
2. Temporality or time period (Header)
3. Narration (Body)
4. Beginning (Body)
5. End (Body)
6. Causation and insights (Body)
	6.1 X-axis
	6.2 Y-axis
7. Narration or conclusion from the data visualization (Footer)


PRINCIPLES OF DATA STORYTELLING
1. It needs to be relevant.
			This means the content of your story should fit the audience’s current level of understanding that will help them reach a goal of some kind.

2. It needs to include good data.
			This means the data should be from a reliable source and/or collected in a way that truly represents what’s needed to tell a truthful story.

3. There needs to be a clear narratives.
			There should be a beginning, middle, and end. You need an introduction to the topic and need to conclude with a specific call to action.

4. It should include intentional visuals.
			The visuals should help the audience easily understand what the data means. It should be appropriate for the data, well-labeled, readable, and never misleading.

***************************************

* Project #2
Look for a dataset (with Latitude and Longitude features) to develop a dashboard with any of the geoplots (Dot Map, Choropleth, Connection Map).

Integrate in the web app developed.
